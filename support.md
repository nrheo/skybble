## Frequently Asked Questions

### üí≠ How do I make a new cloud?

To create a new note, go to the **menu bar** at the top of your screen. Then click **New** and choose your desired cloud shape from the list ‚Äî your new note will appear on your desktop instantly. Each cloud shape offers a unique look and vibe, so pick the one that fits your style or mood.

### üå¨Ô∏è How do I turn on the floating animation?

Skybble lets you make your notes gently float with a built-in animation feature. To enable it, first click the animation icon on any individual note to toggle floating *on* for that cloud. Once you've enabled animation on one or more notes, go to the **menu bar,** click on **Animation** then select **Start Animation**. This will activate floating movement for all notes that have the animation toggle turned on. You can stop the animation anytime using the **Stop Animation** option in the menu bar. It‚Äôs a fun way to bring motion and life to your desktop workspace.

### üìå How do I pin notes to stay on top?

Each Skybble note has a **pin icon**. Clicking this icon will keep the cloud note pinned above all other windows ‚Äî meaning it will stay visible even when you‚Äôre using other apps or switching between desktops. This is especially useful for to-do lists, reminders, or notes you reference frequently. You can unpin the note at any time if you want it to behave like a regular window again. It‚Äôs a simple way to make sure your most important thoughts never get lost behind other tasks.

### üé® How can I change the font and color?

Skybble allows full personalization of your notes right from the **menu bar**. After creating a note:

- Click **STYLE** to customize the cloud‚Äôs **color and shape**. Choose from a variety of soft, fun, or minimal designs to match your desktop vibe.
- Click **FONT** to change the **typeface and size** of your note‚Äôs text. Whether you want a playful handwritten look or something clean and professional, there‚Äôs a font for you.

These settings apply to the currently active cloud note, so make sure you click the note you want to customize first.

### üóÇ Where can I find my notes?

Skybble cloud notes appear directly on your desktop and float (or stay pinned) independently. Once you‚Äôve created a note, it remains visible on screen until you close it manually. If you close the **Skybble home window**, your notes will still remain active. You can always access the app again by clicking the cloud icon and **menu bar**, where you can create new notes, manage animations, or access customization options.

## üí° Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Notes not floating?** Make sure you‚Äôve toggled animation **on** for the note (via its icon), then go to the menu bar and select **Start Animation**.
- **Accidentally closed the home window?** No worries ‚Äî click the **Skybble icon in your menu bar** to reopen it.
- **Want to delete a note?** Click the **X** button on the corner of the cloud to remove it from your screen.
