## 📌 Frequently Asked Questions

### 💭 How do I make a new cloud?

To create a new note, go to the **menu bar** at the top of your screen. Then click **NEW** and choose your desired cloud shape from the list — your new note will appear on your desktop instantly. Each cloud shape offers a unique look and vibe, so pick the one that fits your style or mood.

### 🌬️ How do I turn on the floating animation?

Skybble lets you make your notes gently float with a built-in animation feature. To enable it, first click the animation icon on any individual note to toggle floating *on* for that cloud. Once you've enabled animation on one or more notes, go to the **menu bar,** click on **Animation** then select **Start Animation**. This will activate floating movement for all notes that have the animation toggle turned on. You can stop the animation anytime using the **Stop Animation** option in the menu bar. It’s a fun way to bring motion and life to your desktop workspace.

### 📌 How do I pin notes to stay on top?

Each Skybble note has a **pin icon**. Clicking this icon will keep the cloud note pinned above all other windows — meaning it will stay visible even when you’re using other apps or switching between desktops. This is especially useful for to-do lists, reminders, or notes you reference frequently. You can unpin the note at any time if you want it to behave like a regular window again. It’s a simple way to make sure your most important thoughts never get lost behind other tasks.

### 🎨 How can I change the font and color?

Skybble allows full personalization of your notes right from the **menu bar**. After creating a note:

- Click **STYLE** to customize the cloud’s **color and shape**. Choose from a variety of soft, fun, or minimal designs to match your desktop vibe.
- Click **FONT** to change the **typeface and size** of your note’s text. Whether you want a playful handwritten look or something clean and professional, there’s a font for you.

These settings apply to the currently active cloud note, so make sure you click the note you want to customize first.

### 🗂 Where can I find my notes?

Skybble cloud notes appear directly on your desktop and float (or stay pinned) independently. Once you’ve created a note, it remains visible on screen until you close it manually. If you close the **Skybble home window**, your notes will still remain active. You can always access the app again by clicking the cloud icon and **menu bar**, where you can create new notes, manage animations, or access customization options.

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Notes not floating?** Make sure you’ve toggled animation **on** for the note (via its icon), then go to the menu bar and select **Start Animation**.
- **Accidentally closed the home window?** No worries — click the **Skybble icon in your menu bar** to reopen it.
- **Want to delete a note?** Click the **X** button on the corner of the cloud to remove it from your screen.
- **Customizations not applying?** Ensure the note you want to update is the most recently clicked (active) cloud.
